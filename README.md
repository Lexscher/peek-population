# Peek Population

Data Visualization with D3!
See our current population with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/).

This project uses Webpack, which is unnecessary. I used Webpack for learning purposes only.

Please follow my [medium post](https://medium.com/@lexscher/d3-me-2f515f51dd00), which explains how to build the application.
